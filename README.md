# Machine-Learning
1. Add more predictors
2. Try different models (e.g random forest, neural network, etc.)
3. In the athletes_events data set, create a model for if a specific athlete would win a medal and add the results together to figure out how many medals each country would win
4. Measure errors more accurately 
5. Make a different model for higher error prone countries
